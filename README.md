My solutions to [adventofcode.com](adventofcode.com)

Most of the time this will be extremely hard to read as I'll be semi-code-golfing (not actually aiming for the lowest amount of chars but I will try to keep my solutions short, as a one-liner if possible)

Also I'll use JS files in here, but my solutions are meant (unless stated otherwise I guess, we'll see) to be executed in a JS console on the puzzle input page in a recent-enough browser (I'll be using Chrome but I assume it will always work in Firefox). This is because:
- I'll be using ES6 features (arrow functions etc.)
- I'll be using console-specific features (`$` = `document.querySelector` - available in Chrome and Firefox)
- I'll be grabbing the data directly from the page (`textContent`)
