My solutions to [adventofcode.com](adventofcode.com)

Most of the time this will be extremely hard to read as I am code-golfing (aiming for the lowest amount of chars).  
Unless it impacts the performance too much: if a shorter version takes 10 minutes to run instead of 1 second, I'll go for the one with slightly more characters.

Also I'll use JS files in here, but my solutions are meant (unless stated otherwise) to be executed in a JS console on the puzzle input page (I'll be using Chrome but I assume it will always work in Firefox). This is because:
- I am using ES6 features (arrow functions etc.)
- I am using console-specific features (`$` = `document.querySelector` - available at least in Chrome and Firefox)
- I am grabbing the data directly from the page (`innerText`)
